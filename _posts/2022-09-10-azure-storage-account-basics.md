There are 3 major types of Azure Storage Accounts. Per domain or host you need to create one account. Some time based on features also you create accounts. Example: If you want to create sales.storage.com, pricing.storage.com then for each host name you need new storage account. Next if you want to create Azure premium storage account then it is separate account all together. Within Azure storage account you can have many tiers. However, if you want premium tier then you must create separate account all together called [Premium Storage account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-premium-storage-high-performance-storage-for-azure-virtual-machine-workloads/).
