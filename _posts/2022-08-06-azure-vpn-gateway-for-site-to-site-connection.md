## Azure VPN gateways

A VPN gateway is a type of Virtual Network Gateway.

If you want to setup below connections then you need VPN Gateway:

- Connect on-premises data centers to Azure virtual networks through a _site-to-site_ connection.
- Connect individual devices to Azure virtual networks through a _point-to-site_ connection.
- Connect Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks through a _network-to-network_ connection.

You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network, but you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations.

## VPN Types

The main difference of these two types of `VPNs` is how traffic to be encrypted is specified.

- policy-based
- route-based

## Policy-based VPNs

Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel.

- Support for `IKEv1` only.
- Used for compatibility with legacy on-premises VPN devices.
- The source and destination of the tunneled networks are declared in the policy and don't need to be declared in routing tables.
