> Now a days distributed architecture is common. We deploy our services into many different servers to scale them up and meet our demand. However, managing all servers for **load-balancing, scaling, make application highly available** is super challenging on cloud. **Azure Virtual Machine Scale sets** is the great tool which does all of these automatically with **no extra cost** for you. Lets learn more about Scale sets in this article.

### Why Distributed Architecture?

- To provide **redundancy and improved performance**, applications are typically **distributed across multiple instances**.
- In order to give your customer faster speed and low latency you may need **load balancer** that **distributes requests** to one of the application **instances**.

## What is Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets?

- Virtual Machine scale set let you **Create** and **Manage** a **group of load balanced VMs**.
- The number of VM instances can **automatically increase or decrease** in response to demand or a defined schedule.
- With virtual machine scale sets, you can build **large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads**.
- Scale sets provide **high availability to your applications**, and allow you to **centrally manage**, **configure**, and **update** a large number of VMs.
- **Consistent Configuration**: Virtual Machine scale sets are the objects that are used to run multiple instances of your application and maintain a consistent configuration across your environment.

{: .notice--info}
VMs in a scale set are identical, so you can create them from the same base operating system image.

### Why use Virtual Machine Scale Sets?

- **Maintenance Mode Support**: If you need to perform maintenance or update an application instance, your customers must be distributed to another available application instance.
- **Automatically increase VM instances**: To keep up with additional customer demand, you may need to increase the number of application instances that run your application.
  - Auto scale based on metrics.
  - Auto scale based on a defined schedule. Suppose starting next week you are going to have a heavy peak, for next 3 days. You can define a set schedule. For example, at 9 am on Jan 2nd 2021, increase the VM instance count to 50. And at 9PM on Jan 5th when your peak ends, bring the instance count back to your baseline configuration.
- **Easy to create and manage multiple VMs** : It maintains a consistent configuration (VM size, disk configuration) across your environment. All VM instances are created from the same base OS image and configuration. This approach lets you easily manage hundreds of VMs without additional configuration tasks or network management. For basic layer-4 traffic distribution it uses Azure Load Balancer. And for advanced layer-7 it uses Azure Application Gateway.
- **Provides high availability and application resiliency**: If one of these VM instances has a problem, customers continue to access your application through one of the other VM instances with minimal interruption.
- **Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes**: Like it auto increase VM instances. It can also minimizes the number of unnecessary VM instances that run your application when demand is low, while customers continue to receive an acceptable level of performance
- **Works at large-scale** : Up to **1000** Azure VM, and custom VM images up to **600** VM.

## Scale set saves money ðŸ’°

The **management** and **automation** features, such as auto-scale and redundancy, incur **no additional charges** over the use of VMs. You only pay for the underlying compute resources such as the VM instances, load balancer, or Managed Disk storage.

## Benefits of Scale Set

| High availability and redundancy | Manually create Availability set or distribute and track VMs across Availability Zones | Automatic distribution of VM instances across Availability Zones or Availability Sets |
| Scaling of VMs                   | Manual monitoring and Azure Automation                                                 | Auto scale based on host metrics, in-guest metrics, Application Insights, or schedule |

## How to monitor scale sets

- Use [Azure Monitor for VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview), to see metrics about VM CPU, memory, disk and network performance
- Enable monitoring [virtual machine scale set application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-vm-vmss-apps) with Application Insights to collect detailed information about your application including page views, application requests, and exceptions.
- Configure [availability test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability) to check application availability to simulate user traffic.
