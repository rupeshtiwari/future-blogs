> What is Azure accounts? Why do we need Azure accounts to be created? How resources and subscriptions are attached to Azure accounts? Learn everything about Azure accounts in this article. This article is part of **Core Azure Concepts**

## What is the Azure account?

To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When you create an **Azure account** then Azure subscription will be created automatically for you. You're free to create additional subscriptions. Next, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.

You **don't need to purchase an Azure account** before you can use any Azure resources. Because, You can use a free Azure account or a Microsoft Learn sandbox to create resources.

## What is the Azure free account?

The Azure free account includes:

- Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
- A credit to spend for the first 30 days.
- Access to more than 25 products that are always free.

## What is the Learn sandbox?

Maximum **Learn** exercises use a technology called the **sandbox**, which creates a temporary subscription that's added to your Azure account. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you've completed the module. The sandbox is the preferred method to use though, because it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost to you.
